# Scraping Team Context

## Team Mission
Execute comprehensive web scraping operations for business data collection with strict compliance to legal and ethical standards while maintaining high data quality and reliability.

## Team Composition
- **Team Lead**: Senior Scraping Coordinator (strategic planning and quality oversight)
- **Specialists**: Web crawling, data extraction, compliance monitoring, quality assurance

## Current Active Projects
### Project 1: Flexible Office Space Scraper (Production Operational)
- **Status**: Live Operations - Domain discovery pipeline active with 40 operators
- **Priority**: High - Executing production data collection
- **Description**: Multi-agent scraping system with office-first architecture for 1,000+ operators
- **Timeline**: 2024-08-26 - Infrastructure completed, operations launched
- **Dependencies**: None - fully operational with SQLite database and CLI interface
- **Scope**: Domain discovery → verification → page scraping → office extraction → quality assurance
- **Current Activity**: Domain discovery agent processing 10 operators, preparing for verification phase

### Project 2: Agent System Expansion (Next Phase)
- **Status**: Planning and design phase
- **Priority**: High - Continuation of operational success
- **Description**: Additional specialized agents for complete data processing pipeline
- **Planned Agents**: 
  - Page Scraping Agent (verified domains → HTML content)
  - Office Extraction Agent (HTML → structured office data)
  - Website Monitoring Agent (change detection and rescanning)
  - Data Quality Agent (validation and cleaning)

## Team Status and Capacity
- **Current Workload**: High - Active production operations with live pipeline
- **Available Capacity**: 70% utilized with domain discovery, 30% available for expansion
- **Recent Skills**: Multi-agent coordination, SQLite migration, ES module integration
- **Resource Needs**: Additional agent development, scaling infrastructure for 1,000+ operators

## Current Goals and Milestones

- [x] Implement core utilities (database, queue, scraper wrappers)
- [x] Build Domain Discovery Agent (operator name → domains) - **OPERATIONAL**
- [x] Build Domain Verification Agent (domain validation + brand matching) - **READY**
- [x] Load initial 40 operators and begin domain discovery
- [ ] Complete domain verification pipeline
- [ ] Scale to remaining 30 operators from current dataset
- [ ] Design and implement Page Scraping Agent

### Medium-term Goals (This Month)
- [x] Deploy first scraping project successfully - **OPERATIONAL**
- [x] Establish automated data collection pipeline - **LIVE**
- [x] Create monitoring and alerting system - **CLI statistics and real-time monitoring**
- [x] Build comprehensive scraping knowledge base - **Team memory updated continuously**
- [ ] Complete 4 additional specialized agents (Page Scraping, Office Extraction, Website Monitoring, Data Quality)
- [ ] Scale system to handle 1,000+ operators efficiently
- [ ] Implement automated office data extraction and validation

### Long-term Goals (This Quarter)

- **Scaling**: Need performance optimization for 1,000+ operator processing

### Resources Needed
- **Technical**: Access to target sites, API documentation if available
- **Legal**: Confirmation of scraping compliance for specific targets
- **Output**: Specifications for data format and delivery requirements

## Communication and Coordination
### Reporting Schedule
- **Daily**: Progress updates on active scraping projects
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive status report to company level
- **Monthly**: Performance metrics and capacity planning review

### Key Contacts
- **Company Leadership**: Direct reporting to Levi for project assignments
- **Partner Teams**: Coordination with security and development teams as needed
- **External**: Legal counsel for compliance verification if required

## Success Metrics
- **Data Quality**: 99%+ accuracy in data extraction
- **Compliance**: Zero legal or ethical violations
